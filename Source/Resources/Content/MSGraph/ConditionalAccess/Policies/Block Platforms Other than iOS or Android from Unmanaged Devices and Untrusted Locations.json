  "description": "**What does this do?**\nBlocks platforms other than iOS and Android from devices that are off-network and not Intune-managed. The baseline assigns the policy to all users except those in the Azure AD group 'Baseline - Unrestricted Access From Unmanaged Devices And Untrusted Locations.' The policy also excludes applications listed in the config property 'AppsAllowedFromUntrustedLocations.' \n\n**Why should you use this?**\nThis policy helps protect your data by blocking authentication from untrusted devices and locations. Application protection policies on iOS and Android have been tested and verified to protect data.\n\n**What is the end-user impact?**\nUsers are restricted to iOS and Android platforms for authenticating devices when connecting from untrusted devices and locations.\n\n**Learn more**\n[How you can protect app data](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/apps/app-protection-policy)",
