  "description": "#### **What does this do?**\n\nRequires that a device be registered in Autopilot by uploading a hardware hash before it can be enrolled in Intune. To bypass this requirement, a user must be a member of the Azure AD group 'Baseline - Device Enrollers.'\n\n#### **Why should you use this?**\n\nThis increases security by preventing unauthorized devices from being enrolled into your tenant. \n\n#### **What is the end-user impact?**\n\nIT must register devices in Autopilot before a general user can enroll it.\n\n#### **Learn more**\n\nN/A",
