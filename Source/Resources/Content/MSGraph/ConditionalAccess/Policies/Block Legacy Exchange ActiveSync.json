  "description": "**What does this do?**\nBlocks Exchange ActiveSync, which disables native iOS and Android mail clients. The baseline blocks Exchange Active sync for all users except those in the Azure AD group 'Baseline - Unrestricted Access From Unmanaged Devices And Untrusted Locations.'\n\n**Why should you use this?**\nIt is recommended to disable native mail applications since they do not provide the same level of security and functionality as Microsoft Outlook.\n\n**What is the end-user impact?**\nUsers cannot use native mail applications except if specifically allowed.\n\n**Learn more**\n[Policy recommendations for securing email](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/secure-email-recommended-policies?view=o365-worldwide)",
