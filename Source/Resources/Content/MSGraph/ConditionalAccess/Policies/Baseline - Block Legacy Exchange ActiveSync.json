The baseline blocks Exchange Active sync for all users except those in the Azure AD group \"Baseline - Unrestricted Access From Unmanaged Devices And Untrusted Locations.\" |\n| Why should you use this? | It is recommended to disable native mail applications since they do not provide the same level of security and functionality as Microsoft Outlook. |\n| What is the end-user impact? | <span style='color: red'>High Impact.</span> Users cannot use native mail applications except if specifically allowed. |\n| Learn more | [Policy recommendations for securing email](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/secure-email-recommended-policies?view=o365-worldwide) |",
