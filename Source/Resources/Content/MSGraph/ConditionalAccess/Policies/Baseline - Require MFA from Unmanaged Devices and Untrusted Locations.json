  "description": "| What does this do? | Requires MFA when authenticating from a non-compliant device that is off-network. The baseline requires MFA from all users except those with the Azure AD role 'Directory Synchronization Accounts.' |\n| Why should you use this? | This further protects your data by ensuring that a device connecting to your network is compliant. |\n| What is the end-user impact? | Users must authenticate using MFA when accessing Microsoft 365 data from a non-compliant, off-network device. |\n| Learn more | [How to: Require MFA for access from untrusted networks with Conditional Access](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/untrusted-networks) |",
