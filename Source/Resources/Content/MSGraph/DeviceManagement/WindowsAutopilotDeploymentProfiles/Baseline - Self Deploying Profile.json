  "description": "**What does this do?**\n\nCreates an Intune autopilot profile for enrolling machines using the self-deploying method, which enables a device to be enrolled into your environment with little to no user interaction. Self-deployment mode comes with restrictions including that the device must have TPM 2.0, and it is not supported on virtual machines even if they have a virtual TPM. Devices in the Azure AD group 'BUILTIN - Autopilot Devices - Self Deploying' will be assigned this profile. \n\n**Why should you use this?**\n\nThis is most useful for devices that will be shared or used as a kiosk. If a device is going to be used by a single user it is best to use the user-driven method.\n\n**What is the end-user impact?**\n\nUser devices assigned to this profile can be configured using the self-deployment method.\n\n**Learn more**\n\n[Windows Autopilot Self-Deploying mode](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/autopilot/self-deploying)",
