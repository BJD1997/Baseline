  "description": "**What does this do?**\n\nAutomatically and silently configures OneDrive and enables the Files On Demand feature.\n\n**Why should you use this?**\n\nAllows users to store data in OneDrive and access it without downloading all OneDrive content to the computer.\n\n**What is the end-user impact?**\n\nThe first time a user logs in to a device, OneDrive will automatically sign in. Upon first sign-in the user will be able to see all her files, but not all files need to be downloaded to the computer. Files stored in the cloud will have a cloud icon in the corner, whereas files stored locally will have a green checkmark. \n\n**Learn more**\n\n[Sync files with OneDrive Files on Demand](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/sync-files-with-onedrive-files-on-demand-62e8d748-7877-420f-b600-24b56562aa70)"
