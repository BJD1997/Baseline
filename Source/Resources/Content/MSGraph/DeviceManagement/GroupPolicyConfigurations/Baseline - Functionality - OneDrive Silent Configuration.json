  "$description": "| What does this do? | Automatically and silently configures OneDrive and enables the Files On Demand feature. |\n| Why should you use this? | Allows users to store data in OneDrive and access it without downloading all OneDrive content to the computer. |\n| What is the end-user impact? | The first time a user logs in to a device, OneDrive will automatically sign in. Upon first sign-in the user will be able to see all her files, but not all files need to be downloaded to the computer. Files stored in the cloud will have a cloud icon in the corner, whereas files stored locally will have a green checkmark. |\n| Learn more | [Sync files with OneDrive Files on Demand](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/sync-files-with-onedrive-files-on-demand-62e8d748-7877-420f-b600-24b56562aa70) |",
