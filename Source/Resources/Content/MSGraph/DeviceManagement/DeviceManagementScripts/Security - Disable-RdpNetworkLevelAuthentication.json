  "description": "What is it: Disables NLA as a requirement for RDP, required to support clients that do not support NLA. \n Simeon Notes: It is not currently possible to pre-authenticate when RDP'ing into an Azure AD joined Windows device unless the client is also joined to that Azure AD. Removing the requirement for NLA will not prevent clients from trying to negotiate NLA if they support it. That means that Windows clients that are not joined to the same Azure AD domain as the host must explicitly add 'enablecredsspsupport:i:0' in the RDP file when connecting to prevent attempts to pre-authenticate.",
