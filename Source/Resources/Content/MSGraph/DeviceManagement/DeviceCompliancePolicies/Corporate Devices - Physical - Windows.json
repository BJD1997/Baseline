  "description": "**What does this do?**\nDefines the required state that a physical device must be in to be considered compliant and before it can access organization data. The baseline requires that a physical device has a number of security controls configured including BitLocker encryption and a Microsoft Defender ATP risk score of medium or less. Assignment is based on the Azure AD group 'Baseline - Corporate Devices â€“ Physical'. This policy applies only to physical devices since some requirements such as BitLocker are not supported on virtual devices. \n**Why should you use this?**\nThis provides a layer of data protection for your Intune managed devices. \n**What is the end-user impact?**\nUsers may only access organization data if the device passes the compliance policy conditions.\n**Learn more**\n[Use compliance policies to set rules for devices you manage with Intune](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/protect/device-compliance-get-started)",
