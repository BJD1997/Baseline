  "$description": "| What does this do? | Defines the required state that a physical device must be in to be considered compliant and before it can access organization data. The baseline requires that a physical device has a number of security controls configured including BitLocker encryption and a Microsoft Defender ATP risk score of medium or less. Assignment is based on the Azure AD group \"Baseline - Corporate Devices â€“ Physical\". This policy applies only to physical devices since some requirements such as BitLocker are not supported on virtual devices. |\n| Why should you use this? | This ensures your managed Windows devices meet a minimum level of security to access data. |\n| What is the end-user impact? | Users may only access organization data if the device passes the compliance policy conditions. |\n| Learn more | [Use compliance policies to set rules for devices you manage with Intune](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/protect/device-compliance-get-started) |",
