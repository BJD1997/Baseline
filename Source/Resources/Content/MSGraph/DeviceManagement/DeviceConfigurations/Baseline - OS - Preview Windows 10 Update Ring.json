  "description": "#### **What does this do?**\n\nCreates a Windows Update configuration for Intune-managed devices in the 'Preview' ring, which receive updates after 'Insiders' but before devices with the default policy. The baseline delays feature and quality updates to the 'Preview' group for 7 days after released by Microsoft. Once the deferral period has expired for a device, users have 3 days to restart (if required). Unattended updates will only be applied outside working hours of 5am to 10pm. Applies to users in the Azure AD group 'Baseline - Corporate Devices â€“ Preview'. \n\n#### **Why should you use this?**\n\nA Windows update ring is the best way to ensure Windows updates are compatible in your environment by testing the update in rings of users.. \n\n#### **What is the end-user impact?**\n\nUsers in the 'Preview' ring will receive updates 7 days after being released by Microsoft and after Insiders, but before devices with the default policy. \n\n#### **Learn more**\n\n[Tactical considerations for creating Windows deployment rings](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-it-pro-blog/tactical-considerations-for-creating-windows-deployment-rings/ba-p/746979)",
