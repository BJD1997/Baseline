  "description": "#### **What does this do?**\nCreates a dynamic group that assigns Microsoft 365 licenses to users for EMS and O365 functionality. This group also controls policies that should be applied to all users (e.g. password reset). The baseline places users that have a department into this group. If a user does not require a license (e.g. service accounts or off-boarded users), the department should be removed for that user.\n\n#### **Why should you use this?**\nIf you want to dynamically manage the user license assignment and policies directed at licensed users.\n\n#### **What is the end-user impact?**\nUsers with a department will be assigned appropriate licenses. \n\n#### **Learn more**\n\n[Assign licenses to users](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/manage/assign-licenses-to-users?view=o365-worldwide)\n\n[Editing a user's department](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-users-profile-azure-portal)",
