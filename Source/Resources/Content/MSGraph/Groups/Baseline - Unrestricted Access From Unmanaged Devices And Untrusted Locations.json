  "description": "**What does this do?**\n\nCreates a group that is used to bypass conditional access and mobile application protection policies that ensure content is accessed only from trusted devices, locations, and applications. The 'Baseline - Global Admin' account is added to this group.\n\n**Why should you use this?**\n\nIf you want to allow certain users (e.g. a CEO or IT support user) to access content with a lesser degree of content security than is applied by default (e.g. using a personal computer or the native iOS mail app which does not protect content).\n\n**What is the end-user impact?**\n\nUsers in this group can use any device or application of their choosing to access Microsoft 365 resources without any content protection policies.\n\n**Learn more**\n\n[Only allow apps that support protection policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/app-based-conditional-access)\n\n[Protecting content on personal devices using app protection policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/apps/app-protection-policy)",
