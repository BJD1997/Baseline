  "description": "#### **What does this do?**\nCreates a dynamic device group for assigning user-driven Autopilot profiles to devices. This group includes all devices that are not in the Azure AD group 'Autopilot Devices - Self Deploying.'\n\n#### **Why should you use this?**\nWhen a device is going to be used by a single user, this approach is ideal because the device shows as assigned in all relevant Intune pages and reports. It is also the most stable and consistent Autopilot mode.\n\n#### **What is the end-user impact?**\nDevices with this profile can be enrolled by users themselves. The device will be registered to the user and the user will be able to use the company portal application. \n\n#### **Learn more**\n\n[Windows Autopilot User-Driven mode](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/autopilot/user-driven)",
