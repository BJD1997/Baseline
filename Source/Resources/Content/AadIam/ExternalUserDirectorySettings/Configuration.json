The baseline allows only authorized users with the \"Guest Inviter\" role to invite external collaborators. |\n| Why should you use this? | The Azure default allows all users and guests to invite external users, so we recommend using the baseline setting to tighten security. |\n| What is the end-user impact? | Users will not be able to invite external collaborators unless authorized. |\n| Learn more | [Configure B2B external collaboration settings](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/external-identities/delegate-invitations) |",
