  "description": "| What does this do? | Analyzes signals from user sign-ins and calculates a risk score based on the probability that the sign-in wasn't performed by the user. |\n| Why should you use this? | Automates the response to risk detections in your environment and allow users to self-remediate when risk is detected. |\n| What is the end-user impact? | When the policy triggers, the user will need MFA to access the account. In the case of a user who hasn't registered MFA on their account, they would be blocked from accessing their account. It is important to configure the MFA registration policy for all users who are a part of the sign-in risk policy to ensure that they have registered MFA. |\n| Learn more | [Sign-in risk policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/concept-identity-protection-policies#sign-in-risk-policy) |",
